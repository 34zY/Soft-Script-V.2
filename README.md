# Soft-Script-V.2
Soft Script is a tool to use in local area, physical pentesting on windows machines, this tool is just a project that I wanted to make while I was lazy so it's probably doesn't get any update, umm maybe not, well gonna see!

**The name of this executable is a random name that I wrote to the victim be confused when he is gonna see this in background process on windows**
